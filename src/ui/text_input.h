// text_input.h — what untrusted text has to survive before it becomes a prompt.
//
// Anything a person can paste can arrive here: a fragment of a binary file, a
// half-decoded mail body, a megabyte of control characters. A prompt is then sent
// somewhere that will act on it, so this is a trust boundary rather than a
// convenience — and it is the one thing list0's prompt editor had that a plain
// editing model does not.
//
// pf::ui::text_buffer is an editing model. It happily holds whatever bytes it is
// given, which is right for a document loaded from disk and wrong for a field a
// stranger's text can reach. This is the filter in front of it.
//
// Everything here is pure, so all of it is directly testable.
